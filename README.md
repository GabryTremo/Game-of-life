# Game-of-life-in-Cpp
An attempt at building a version of Conway's Game of Life as a personal project. Specifically, here the sides of the playing square are identified pairwise, as if the game happens on a torus.

It was done in C++ at first, using mainly C syntax, and then in MATLAB. Of course, the MATLAB code is shorter and more efficient, as the programs works with matrices. Both versions have some degree of animation: the MATLAB version has been very easily animated with the imshow command; in the C++ version only a rudimentary animation on the terminal has been created.
